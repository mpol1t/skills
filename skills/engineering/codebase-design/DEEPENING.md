# Deepening

How to deepen a cluster of shallow modules safely, given its dependencies. Assumes the vocabulary in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**.

## Dependency categories

When assessing a candidate for deepening, classify its dependencies. The category determines how the deepened module is tested across its seam.

### 1. In-process

Separate pure computation from mutable in-memory state: no I/O does not establish purity. Merge only when this improves locality without losing useful domain contracts or composition. Keep state ownership and observable effects explicit. Test pure contracts directly and verify their orchestration through the resulting interface.

### 2. Local-substitutable

Dependencies that have local test stand-ins (PGLite for Postgres, in-memory filesystem). Deepenable if the stand-in exists. The deepened module is tested with the stand-in running in the test suite. The seam is internal; no port at the module's external interface.

### 3. Remote but owned (Ports & Adapters)

Your own services across a network boundary (microservices, internal APIs). Define a **port** (interface) at the seam. The deep module owns the logic; the transport is injected as an **adapter**. Tests use an in-memory adapter. Production uses an HTTP/gRPC/queue adapter.

Recommendation shape: *"Define a port at the seam, implement an HTTP adapter for production and an in-memory adapter for testing, so the logic sits in one deep module even though it's deployed across a network."*

### 4. True external (Mock)

Third-party services (Stripe, Twilio, etc.) you don't control. The deepened module takes the external dependency as an injected port; tests provide a mock adapter.

## Seam discipline

- **Justify the seam.** Name the variation, effect isolation, or domain invariant it protects. One production adapter can suffice; add test adapters only when they improve verification.
- **Internal seams vs external seams.** A deep module can have internal seams (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the external seam at its interface. Don't expose internal seams through the interface just because tests use them.

## Testing strategy: preserve distinct evidence

- Retain stable pure-domain law tests and useful examples alongside integration coverage. Delete old tests only when their contract is obsolete or their evidence is demonstrably duplicated.
- Verify the deepened module through its interface and stable domain operations through theirs. The **interface is the test surface**; use the narrowest contract that owns the behavior plus integration tests for orchestration.
- Tests assert on observable outcomes through the interface, not internal state.
- Tests should survive internal refactors, since they describe behaviour, not implementation. If a test has to change when the implementation changes, it's testing past the interface.
